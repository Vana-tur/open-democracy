# A mobile app to save the republic

The long delay and uncertainty in measuring the opinion of the people leads to monopoly of few parties, extreme polarization and general instability.

Simple, reliable, fast and anonymous system for voting would help, but unfortunately, it is not possible to have all four. Many would argue that anonymity is the most important feature of the current voting system, to the point of showing bulletins being illegal in some places, but what if importance of anonymity is mostly an artefact of rarity and non-granularity of decisions we vote for?

Now we need extra protection against selling votes, or voters being intimidated, because a vote gives very little benefit to the voter, and huge benefit to the elected, leading to most people not being able to correctly price the effects of their vote. If voters had opportunity to decide on every issue individually, the game dynamics would change, and people would be able to protect their votes by themselves.

With this approach people still do not have to pay attention to every issue. They could set their vote to match someone else's, or could trade their support for a law with other people, but they would have a real way to influence decisions they care about instead of screaming into void in the form of petitions or costly protests. And politicians would have a way to precisely know what the people want.

Unfortunately no government will want its function to be commoditized in this way, even though it has lots to gain from a more stable system, but luckily the system can be started small.

The software needed for this shouldn't be much more complicated than normal forum/social media app/change.org. A startup would partner with local politicians/small parties/activists to collect and verify the users. Users would have incentive to vote for politicians using the software, since they would gain an opportunity to be heard, and politicians if elected via app, will have to always vote according to the changing preferences of users who have voted for them.
